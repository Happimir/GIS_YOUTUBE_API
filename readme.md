#Youtube API Project

#Important
***YOU MUST HAVE COMPOSER INSTALLED, GO TO COMPOSER.ORG FOR INSTRUCTIONS!***

##Purpose
    The Purpose of this project was to familiarize ourselves with Youtube's API, along with Google Maps.
    Furthermore, it was a great way to learn how to use an external API in our web project. 
    Was produced for Global Information Systems at the University of Georgia. Instructor: Budak I. Arpinar

##How to Run/Our Testing Environment
    In order to run this code you must have a server running, be it either MAMP, XAMPP (what we used),
    or via an IDE that provides a build-in server like PHPStorm. Note that PHPStorm's server  cannot process POST
    requests, however, our project relies on GET, so if you do use it, then it is not an issue. 
    
    Another important issue is your php.ini file, you must include the following lines in your php.ini
    file: 
    

   `engine=On
     curl.cainfo = "C:\xampp\php\extras\ssl\cacert.pem"`
     
     This is to ensure that we do not have any errors while running, you will have to download a cacert.pem file,
     and then transfer it to your ssl. Of course in this example we used XAMPP, MAMP instructions are different, and 
     I am certain some Google Searching is in order. 
     
##Cloning
    No special clone requirements, just clone the repo, run it, and enjoy.
